This document provides guidelines for using the Gemini Code Assistant with this project.

## Project Overview

This project is a base defense game built with the Godot Engine. The player must build and defend their base from waves of enemies.

## Getting Started

To run the project, open it in the Godot Engine and press the "Play" button.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the project.
  - `scenes/`: Godot scenes, which represent game objects, levels and managers.
  - `scripts/`: GDScript files, which are not attached to nodes like static classes and templates.
  - `resources/`: Game assets, such as images and sounds.
  - `tilesets/`: Godot tilesets for creating game levels.

## Coding Conventions

- Use GDScript for all game logic.
- Follow the official Godot style guide.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use snake_case for functions and variables.
- Use type hints for all variables and functions.
- Always add clear comments to the code.
- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Always explain the changes you are about to make before you start editing the code.

## Influences

This game is highly influenced by Creeper World 3. Many of the systems in this game are inspired by or are direct replications of systems in Creeper World 3. When adding new features, it is likely that they will be very similar to existing features in Creeper World 3.
